# HockeyFightsWebScraper

I created this web scraper to get fight data from https://www.hockeyfights.com/. Specifically, I'm extracting the number of fights per season(only from the last couple seasons for now, although in the future I may get data from every single season) for each team. I then proceed to export this data to a csv file. I am using JavaScript and Puppeteer to accomplish this.

Additionally, this creates another csv file with the team rivals for each time(the top ten teams they've had the most fights with)
